I am Yolande and I am currently pursuing a double major in Computer & Informational Science and Cognitive Science with an anticipated graduation date of May 2026 from the University of Pennsylvania. My interdisciplinary background fuels my profound interest in the convergence of technology, human cognition, and practical applications.

Through hands-on experiences such as my internships at Bank of America and Rockwell Automation, I have developed and deployed scalable solutions, enhanced backend functionalities, and improved user experience. These roles have allowed me to work with various technologies, including Python, Java, Apache, and Spring Boot, and to deliver significant improvements in engineering efficiency and system performance in a team setting and a timely manner. Always excited to learn and tackle interesting problems, I aspire to pursue a career in software development where I can make a meaningful and dynamic impact.
